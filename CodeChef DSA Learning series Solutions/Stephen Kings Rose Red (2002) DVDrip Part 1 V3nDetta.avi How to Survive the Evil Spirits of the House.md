Rose Red is a television miniseries scripted by horror novelist Stephen King. The series was premiered in the United States on ABC on January 27, 2002. The story involves a cavernous Seattle mansion called Rose Red, which is investigated by parapsychologist Dr. Joyce Reardon and a team of psychics.
 
The first part of the miniseries introduces the main characters and sets up the plot. Dr. Reardon is obsessed with proving the existence of paranormal phenomena in Rose Red, a house that has a history of mysterious deaths and disappearances. She recruits a group of people with various psychic abilities, such as telekinesis, precognition, and automatic writing, to explore the mansion and document any evidence of supernatural activity. However, they soon realize that Rose Red is not just haunted, but alive and hungry for more victims.

If you are a fan of Stephen King or haunted house stories, you might enjoy watching Rose Red. The miniseries has a slow but suspenseful pace, a large and diverse cast of characters, and some creepy and creative scares. The story is loosely based on the real-life Winchester Mystery House in California, which was also built by a wealthy widow who believed that ghosts were haunting her. Rose Red is one of King's original works for television, along with The Stand, Storm of the Century, and Kingdom Hospital.

Be warned, though, that this is only the first part of a three-part miniseries, so you might want to watch the other two parts as well to get the full story.
  
The second part of Rose Red continues the exploration of the haunted mansion by Dr. Reardon and her team of psychics. They encounter more manifestations of the house's power, such as moving walls, shifting rooms, and ghostly apparitions. They also learn more about the history of Rose Red and its former inhabitants, especially Ellen Rimbauer, the eccentric widow who built the house and disappeared in it. As the night falls, the house becomes more aggressive and dangerous, and some of the team members start to lose their sanity or their lives.
 
The DVDrip version of the second part of Rose Red is also uploaded by V3nDetta, with the same quality and file size as the first part. The subtitles are also available on [OpenSubtitles.org](https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/ssearch/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-2786) . The runtime is about two hours and fifteen minutes.
 
The second part of Rose Red is more action-packed and thrilling than the first part, as the stakes are raised and the characters face more peril. The miniseries also delves deeper into the mystery and mythology of Rose Red, revealing some of its secrets and origins. The story is influenced by other works of horror literature, such as Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, Richard Matheson's Hell House, and Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher.
