## How to Use Axis 14 Wsdl2javabat?
 
To use the Axis 14 Wsdl2javabat tool, you need to have a valid WSDL document that defines the web service that you want to access. You also need to have Java installed on your system. To generate Java code from a WSDL document, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted the "axis2-maven-tools.jar" file.
2. Type the following command: `wsdl2java.bat -uri  -o `, where <wsdl_url> is the URL or path of the WSDL document, and <output_dir> is the directory where you want to save the generated code.</output_dir></wsdl_url>
3. Press Enter and wait for the tool to finish generating the code.
4. Check the <output_dir> folder for the generated code. You should see a folder structure that matches the namespaces and service names in the WSDL document. Inside each folder, there will be Java files that contain the stubs, data types, and exception classes for the web service.</output_dir>

You can now use the generated code to create a web service client in Java. You will need to add some logic to invoke the web service operations and handle the responses. You will also need to add some dependencies to your project, such as axis2-kernel.jar, axis2-adb.jar, and axis2-transport-http.jar. These jars are included in the downloaded archive of Axis 14.
 
### Conclusion
 
In this article, we have shown you how to download and use the Axis 14 Wsdl2javabat tool to generate Java code from a WSDL document. This tool can help you create web service clients in Java without writing much code by yourself. We hope this article was helpful and informative for you.
