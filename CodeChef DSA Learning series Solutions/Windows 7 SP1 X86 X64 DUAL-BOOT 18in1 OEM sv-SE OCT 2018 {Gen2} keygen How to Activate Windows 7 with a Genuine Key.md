Windows 7 is one of the most popular operating systems in the world, but it is no longer supported by Microsoft since January 2020. If you still want to use Windows 7 on your PC, you may need to download and install a custom version that includes the latest updates and security patches. One of such versions is Windows 7 SP1 X86 X64 DUAL-BOOT 18in1 OEM sv-SE OCT 2018 Gen2, which is a modified ISO file that contains 18 different editions of Windows 7 in both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, as well as a dual-boot option that allows you to choose between Windows 7 and Windows 10. This version also comes with a keygen that can generate valid product keys for activating Windows 7.
