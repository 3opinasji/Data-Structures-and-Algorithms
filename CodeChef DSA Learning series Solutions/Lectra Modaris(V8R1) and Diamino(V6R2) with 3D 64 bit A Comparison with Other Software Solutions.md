Lectra Modaris(V8R1) and Diamino(V6R2) are two software applications that are widely used by fashion designers and pattern makers. They offer a range of features and tools that enable users to create, grade, and optimize patterns, logos, and fabrics in 2D and 3D. In this article, we will explore some of the benefits and capabilities of these software applications, as well as how to install and activate them.
 
## What is Lectra Modaris(V8R1)?
 
Lectra Modaris(V8R1) is a software application that allows users to create and modify patterns in 2D and 3D. It also integrates with Lectra Diamino(V6R2) to optimize fabric consumption and reduce costs. Lectra Modaris(V8R1) offers new time-saving opportunities to apparel designers and graders and significantly improves the productivity of the design department[^1^]. Some of the advantages of Lectra Modaris(V8R1) are:

- New advanced design tools, such as creating developed points in sequence, creating a slanted line, creating a circle (only in Modaris Expert), adding notches to corners, replacing one or more corners of a model, etc.
- Improved virtual pleat management (only in Modaris Expert), which allows users to visualize fold lines and direction, add comments, smooth unsewn side of pleat lines, and plot virtual pleats.
- New tools for refining logos and non-repetitive patterns, such as adding and adjusting patterns and logos on the patterns, grading logos and patterns manually or parametrically (only in Modaris Expert), managing logos and patterns 2D-3D-2D (only in Modaris 3D and Modaris Expert 3D), etc.
- More comprehensive and effective industrialization tools, such as extended grading management, grading in parallel, improved management of size system modification, etc.
- Easier communication, such as exporting to the format for versions prior to Modaris V8, importing Modaris PGS, exporting to DXF-AAMA and DXF-ASTM standard formats, etc.
- Improved virtual assembly (only in Modaris 3D and Modaris Expert 3D), which allows users to simulate the fit and drape of garments on standard or customized mannequins.
- New 3D features (only in Modaris 3D and Modaris Expert 3D), such as new 3D fabric selector, new assembly method by layer, improved 3D simulation, closer management of 3D mesh resolution, new 3D shoulder pad management tool, new management of 3D visuals both within and outside of virtual prototyping, fabric content, standard Alvanon mannequins (under specific licenses), etc.

## What is Lectra Diamino(V6R2)?
 
Lectra Diamino(V6R2) is a software application that allows users to optimize fabric consumption by automatically generating the best marker possible. It also integrates with Lectra Modaris(V8R1) to ensure pattern consistency and quality. Lectra Diamino(V6R2) helps users reduce fabric waste and costs by using advanced algorithms and cutting-edge technologies[^1^]. Some of the advantages of Lectra Diamino(V6R2) are:

- Automatic marker making based on user-defined criteria, such as fabric type, quality zones, grain lines, matching points, etc.
- Manual marker editing with intuitive tools, such as drag-and-drop, copy-paste, rotate-flip-mirror, etc.
- Fabric management with detailed information on fabric properties, such as width, shrinkage, colorways, defects, etc.
- Marker analysis with reports on fabric consumption, efficiency rate, number of pieces per size/colorway/style/etc., cost per garment/meter/etc., etc.
- Marker export to various formats, such as DXF-AAMA/DXF-ASTM/HPGL/ISO/GGT/PLT/etc.
- Marker printing with various options, such as scale factor/print quality/print speed/etc.
